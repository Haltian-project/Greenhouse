# Green House

The project aimed to create an application that monitors the air conditions inside a greenhouse using the Thingsee Air and Environment Sensor. The app would display temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, air pressure, light level, and alert the user if any readings were concerning. The app included a chart feature for users to view past data. The app also has a weather forecast as well as the ability to view electricity prices to help users better manage their crops in the greenhouse.
